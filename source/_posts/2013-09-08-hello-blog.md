# Sam's Blog _| Code, lies, and blargles._

## Hello, blog.
Over the past year or so, I've made copious notes and observations on [coding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming), [software delivery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_deployment), [agile practices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) and other generally programming-related things. Most of these are locked up in private notes, in emails, or just rattling around my brain, and serving no useful purpose to anyone. So, I think it's about time I do what I've been thinking about doing for the last few years, and start adding my own thoughts to the hive mind, lest [SkyNet](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-next-nsa-spying-shoe-to-drop-pre-crime-artificial-intelligence/5339360) sees me only through my 'private' musings.

Now, without any ado, nor adon't, some wordsâ€¦
